# Reflection
During this activity, I faced a lot of challenges that really tested my patience and determination. One of the biggest struggles I encountered was the lack of time. I had to work under pressure to complete the portfolio while also managing other tasks, which made it difficult for me to focus and give my best effort. Because of this, I often felt stressed and worried about not being able to finish on time. However, I realized that staying calm and making use of available resources was the best way to handle the situation.
Another challenge I faced was related to the technical side of the activity. At first, I was unsure how to properly access and organize the code I needed, but using Visual Studio Code really helped me overcome this. The features of the software allowed me to easily manage files and correct mistakes, which made the process more manageable. Aside from that, I was fortunate to have the support of my classmates. They guided me when I got stuck and shared tips that made the activity less overwhelming. With their help, I was able to complete the portfolio successfully.
If I were to improve my portfolio next time, I would focus more on time management. Starting earlier and planning my tasks step by step would help reduce the pressure I felt. I would also improve the design and structure of the portfolio so that it looks more professional and organized. Most importantly, I would continue to practice coding and seek feedback to make the final output even better.
